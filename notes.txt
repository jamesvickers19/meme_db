Download top memes from img flip API and save to files
curl https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes | jq > img_flip_get_memes_api.json

Scrape this page?
https://imgflip.com/memetemplates?sort=top-all-time

Could maybe even scrap this page on the fly, it has a search bar.  Just might be slow that way.

Maybe make this an iMessage extension for Google Image Search instead?
That would be more generally useful but maybe not allowed.

Atlas MongoDb setup
database name: memedb
user: lambdatallc
password: 5TRz5oM8x0mS1d7J

Next:
- Work on mobile app
    - maybe that could just search imgflip on the fly, no need for a database or api ?
    - server could possibly also just search on the fly
- Create HTTP API server for finding memes (stored in MongoDB)
    - can I reuse my existing DigitalOcean droplet?  Probably need a new one
